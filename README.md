# Weather App v2

## Description

This project is a weather website in a cozy style. Users can write the location in the input field and get the weather for the location displayed. A switch between ISO and ANSI is also possible.

## Motivation & Lessons Learned

This project is a revamp of a project I originally did with plain TypeScript for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. The focus on the project was to get used to working with APIs. 
During a job interview for a job I really want to have (wish me luck) the manager told me they work a lot with Angular. So I decided to redo this project as a possibility to get familiar with Angular. 

During this project I learned a lot about Angular Components and Services. I learned how to create and write Angular components and how to pass dynamic values into them. Furthermore I used Sass for the first time and tried out mixins to get more familiar with this tool. It was a nice project and I fixed some issues regarding loading time compared to the original app.
