# Weather App v2

A short revamp of my weather website which I originally did with plain TypeScript.

Since I want to get more familiar with Angular, I decided to redo this project with Angular as a good starting point.

During this project I learned a lot about Angular Components and Services. I learned how to create and write Angular components and how to pass dynamic values into them.

Furthermore I used Sass for the first time and tried out mixins to get more familiar with this tool.

It was a nice project and I fixed some issues regarding loading time compared to the original app.

## Outcomes

- Basic Angular Knowlede regarding Components and Services
- How to deploy an Angular App on Vercel
- How to Setup an Angular App
- Basic Knowledge of Sass
- Refresh Knowledge of working with APIs
